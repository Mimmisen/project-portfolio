THIS TEXT WILL BE DELETED AFTER THE REVIEW, IT'S JUST TO CLARIFY!

article with class tech-section has its opening tag in 61 and closing tag in line 70.

This week's project was to build a portfolio that we are going to use in the future to apply for jobs! The requirements are:

- The page should be built with HTML and CSS (JS if needed)
- You should use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
- The page should be fully responsive (mobile, tablet and desktop)
- The page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- The page should work well for people that use screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- The HTML code should validate in a validation tool.

The challenge this week has also been to copy the figma file design we got as close as possible but with our own touch to it.

It has been fun to do a deep dive in HTML and CSS and I have really enjoyed working with the portfolio,
following a design, perfecting everything, making sure that it looks good in different browsers,
and learning more about how to build up your code in a more convenient way.

The most challenging part of this week has been the accessibility and learning more about how to build your
code and add or remove things to make it accessible for as many people as possible. I think this is a very important
topic and I'll recuse more about it and implant it more in my code in the future!
