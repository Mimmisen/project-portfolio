Always use alt attributes on images
• Avoid "Click here" / "Read more" texts (describe instead)
• Off-screen elements
aria-live="polite" (to tell when something has change on the page)

• Color and contrasts
• Touch areas and size
• Typography and text size (not smaller then 16px)
• Let user's know that content has been changed
• Semantic (h1-h6, button, etc)

look at 'lighthouse' in the inspector for accessibility
