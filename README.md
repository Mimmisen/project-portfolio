Always use alt attributes on images
• Avoid "Click here" / "Read more" texts (describe instead)
• Off-screen elements
aria-live="polite" (to tell when something has change on the page)

• Color and contrasts
• Touch areas and size
• Typography and text size (not smaller then 16px)
• Let user's know that content has been changed
• Semantic (h1-h6, button, etc)

look at 'lighthouse' in the inspector for accessibility

THIS TEXT WILL BE DELETED AFTER THE REVIEW, IT'S JUST TO CLARIFY!
The errors I get from validator.w3.org are not accurate. the div from line 69 has its opening in line 61.
article with class tech-section has its closing tag in line 70.
The empty links I added for screen reading and will be filed when I start adding my content later on.
